luaregisternames package


Sometimes (notably in the case of lua attributes) it is necessary to
access a register _by number_ that has been allocated by tex.
This package provides a function to look up the relevant number
using luatex's internal tables.


To extract the luaregisternames.sty package:
tex luaregisternames.ins
