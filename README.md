Assorted TeX packages

Assorted LaTeX packages written by me all are (or in a couple of cases, have been) on CTAN and should normally be obtained from there.
However development versions obtained from github may sometimes be in advance of the CTAN release.

Issues and comments may also be left on the packages using the github issue tracker.
